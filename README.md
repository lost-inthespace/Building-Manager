## Code content

The code contains a main method that initializes a scanner object and a Helper object. It prompts the user to log in and creates a new building. The system then enters a while loop that displays a menu of options to the user, including the ability to create new units and tenants, manage rent collection and payments, view and edit building and tenant information, and exit the program. The user's input is processed using a switch statement, and the appropriate action is executed based on the selected menu option.
